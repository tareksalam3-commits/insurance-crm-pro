/*
# Insurance CRM Pro - Helper Functions and RLS Policies

Adds hierarchical access control functions and RLS policies for all tables.
- get_subordinate_ids: recursively finds all subordinates of a user
- can_access_user: checks if one user can access another's data
- All tables get SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies
